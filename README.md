# Image_classifer
Intro to Machine Learning - TensorFlow Project Project code for Udacity's 
Intro to Machine Learning with TensorFlow Nanodegree program.

In this project, I will first develop code for an image classifier built with TensorFlow, then I will convert it into a command line application.  In order to complete this project, I will need to use the GPU enabled workspaces within the classroom. 

# Data
The data for this project is quite large - in fact, it is so large you cannot upload it onto Github. If you would like the data for this project, you will want download it from the workspace in the classroom. Though actually completing the project is likely not possible on your local unless you have a GPU. You will be training using 102 different types of flowers, where there ~20 images per flower to train on. Then you will use your trained classifier to see if you can predict the type for new images of the flowers.
